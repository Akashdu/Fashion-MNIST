# Fashion-MNIST using Machine Learning

One of the classic problem that has been used in the Machine Learning world for quite sometime is the MNIST problem. The objective is to identify the digit based on image. But MNIST is not very great problem because we come up with great accuracy even if we are looking at few pixels in the image. So, another common example problem against which we test algorithms is Fashion-MNIST.
